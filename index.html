          <p>
            Village banking is a way for people who know and trust each
            other(like friends,coworkers , or neighbors) to save and borrow
            money together , without needing a bank. A typical group has 5 to 10
            members.They set their own rules, elect leaders , and meet once in a
            week normally a friday to give out loans , track repayments and
            track there savings.
